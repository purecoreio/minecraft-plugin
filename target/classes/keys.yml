  # Hello and Welcome to Core!
  # You need to replace the following values with your API Keys
  # You can setup your network and server instances and get your
  # API Keys here:
  #
  # https://purecore.io/dashboard/wizard
  #
  # If  you're using a proxy instance, you don't have to replace
  # your server key, since it won't be used.
  # If you're using a spigot/game instance, you must replace both
  # "network" and "server" keys.
  #
  # If you need any help or your instance is not working, please,
  # dont leave a bad review on Spigot and contact us here, we
  # usually reply in under an hour :)
