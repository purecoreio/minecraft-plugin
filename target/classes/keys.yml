keys:
  network: "MAIN_NETWORK_KEY" # network api key
  server: "SERVER_INSTANCE_KEY" # if you're running a bungeecord instance, this will be ignored

  # your network instance is the Main account ID for your network, this will relate all the data
  # to a single network. you CAN run multiple network instances.

  # your server instance is the server ID used in spigot servers for stats and
  # other basic functions. You'll need to change this in order to provide basic functions
  # to your spigot server! This type of instance usage is limited by your plan.

  # this two options are NOT using the Key ID. These are using the Key HASH. So, don't show them
  # to nobody!
